# React style component generator
Help you build faster styled component by using fixed format.
By using the fixed format (which will be described next) the command "Generate styled" will generate/add components for you,
Skip the boiler code! :+1:

## Fixed Format
The file format should be as follow: 
1. import the styled component as "S",
2. tags should start with "< S.",
<br />
<br />
<img src="./testImage.JPG" alt="">
<br />
<br />
3. styled component file name will always be "styled.js"
4. styled file structure will be like that: 
<br />
<br />
<img src="./afterCommand.JPG" alt="">
<br />
<br />

## How to use
Their is only one command which is:
*Generate styled*
<br />
<br />
